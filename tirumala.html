      <span class="h">About The Temple :</span
      ><span style="font-weight: 1000"> Sri Venkateswara Temple </span> in
      Tirumala is not just a temple. It is like a living place of devotion where
      prayers, rituals, and service happen every minute of the day. Lakhs of
      devotees visit daily, and everything works in an organized and disciplined
      way. Sri Venkateswara Temple, also called Tirumala Balaji Temple, is one
      of the most famous and holy temples in India. It is located on the
      Tirumala hills near Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh. The temple is dedicated to
      Lord Venkateswara, a form of Lord Vishnu. Long ago, it is believed that
      Lord Vishnu came to earth during Kali Yuga to help people and protect them
      from suffering. He chose Tirumala hills as his home and lived there as
      Lord Venkateswara. The hills are green, peaceful, and full of divine
      energy, which makes them very special. Before staying in Tirumala, Lord
      Venkateswara asked permission from Lord Varaha, who was already living
      there. Lord Varaha happily allowed him to stay. Because of this, devotees
      believe that visiting Varaha Swami first and then Balaji is the correct
      and traditional way of worship. The temple has a long history and has been
      protected and developed by many kings, especially the Vijayanagara kings.
      They donated gold, jewels, land, and wealth to the temple. Even today,
      millions of devotees donate money and offerings with faith and love.
      People believe that Lord Venkateswara fulfills wishes and gives health,
      wealth, peace, and happiness. Devotees often offer hair (tonsure), money,
      laddus, and prayers to show gratitude. The famous Tirupati Laddu is given
      as prasadam and is loved by devotees all over the world. Every day, lakhs
      of people visit the temple for darshan. Important festivals like
      Brahmotsavam, Vaikuntha Ekadashi, and Rathasaptami are celebrated in a
      grand way. The temple rituals are done with great care and devotion. In
      short, Tirumala Balaji Temple is a place of strong faith and hope. People
      believe that Lord Venkateswara listens to prayers and blesses everyone
      equally. Visiting this temple gives peace to the mind and strength to the
      heart.
