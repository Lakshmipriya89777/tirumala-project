      <span class="h">About The Temple :</span> The
      <span style="font-weight: 1000"> Akasaganga</span> is one of the most
      sacred and famous theerthams (holy water places) in Tirumala. It is a
      beautiful natural waterfall located about 3 kilometers away from the main
      Sri Venkateswara Swamy Temple. The name “Akasaganga” means “Ganga from the
      sky,” and devotees strongly believe that this water is not ordinary but
      has a divine and heavenly origin. Pilgrims consider it a very holy spot
      because it is closely connected to the spiritual traditions of Tirumala
      and Lord Venkateswara.
    </div>
    <div class="c">
      According to ancient legends, Akasaganga was revealed through the deep
      devotion of a great devotee named Tirumala Nambi. In olden days, he used
      to bring water from Papavinasanam for the daily rituals and abhishekam of
      Lord Srinivasa. One day, during his journey, a hunter asked him for water.
      After the water was finished, the hunter shot an arrow into the rocks, and
      miraculously a fresh stream of water started flowing from the hill.
      Tirumala Nambi realized that the hunter was actually Lord Srinivasa in
      disguise, blessing the devotees with this sacred water source. Thus,
      Akasaganga became an important holy waterfall of Tirumala.
    </div>
    <div class="c">
      Historically, the water from Akasaganga was carried manually by priests
      and used for the abhishekam (holy bath) of Lord Venkateswara. Even today,
      it remains spiritually significant, and the temple administration
      continues to respect its sacred connection. Many devotees believe that
      praying near Akasaganga or taking blessings from its water helps in
      removing sins, bringing purity, and granting good fortune.
    </div>
    <div class="c">
      Akasaganga is also associated with Anjana Devi, the mother of Lord
      Hanuman. It is believed that she performed penance in this area, and
      nearby there is a small temple dedicated to Sri Balanjaneya Swamy. The
      place is surrounded by green hills, rocky paths, and the soothing sound of
      flowing water, creating a peaceful environment for devotees and visitors.
    </div>
    <div class="c">
      Overall, Akasaganga is not only a holy pilgrimage site but also a serene
      natural treasure of Tirumala, reminding devotees of divine grace,
      devotion, and spiritual purity. Peaceful natural surroundings, best
      visited in the morning. Entry is free for all pilgrims
