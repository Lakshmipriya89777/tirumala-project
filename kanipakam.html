      <span class="h">About The Temple : </span> The
      <span style="font-weight: 1000"> Kanipakam Temple</span> , also known as
      Sri Varasiddhi Vinayaka Swamy Temple, is a famous Hindu temple dedicated
      to Lord Ganesha. It is located in the village of Kanipakam in Chittoor
      district, Andhra Pradesh, India — around 68 km from Tirupati.
      <div>
        <span class="h">History & Origin :</span>
        The temple originates from the 11th century CE, built by the Chola
        emperor Kulothunga Chola I. It was later expanded under the Vijayanagara
        dynasty (14th century), giving it many architectural treasures and a
        grander complex.

        <div class="h">Legend of the Swayambhu Idol:</div>

        According to Sthala Purana (local legend): Three physically challenged
        brothers — one blind, one deaf, and one mute — were trying to dig a well
        for water near their fields. While digging, their tool struck a rock
        which began to bleed, and the water in the well turned red. After
        touching this sacred water, all three brothers were miraculously cured
        of their disabilities. On deeper excavation, villagers discovered a
        self-manifested (Swayambhu) idol of Lord Ganesha (Vinayaka) inside the
        well. The deity was named Sri Varasiddhi Vinayaka — signifying the
        grantor of boons and fulfilment of wishes.
