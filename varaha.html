      <span class="h">About The Temple :</span> The
      <span style="font-weight: 1000"> Varaha Swami Temple</span> is a very
      important temple in Tirumala, Andhra Pradesh. It is dedicated to Lord
      Varaha, who is one form (avatar) of Lord Vishnu. Lord Varaha has the face
      of a boar and the body of a human. This temple is located near the holy
      water tank called Swami Pushkarini, very close to the famous Lord
      Venkateswara (Balaji) Temple. Long ago, it is believed that Lord Varaha
      saved Mother Earth (Bhudevi) from a demon who took her deep into the
      ocean. After saving her, Lord Varaha chose Tirumala hills as his place to
      stay. Because of this, Tirumala was first known as “Adi Varaha Kshetra”,
      which means the land of Lord Varaha. This shows that Varaha Swami lived in
      Tirumala even before Lord Venkateswara came. Later, Lord Venkateswara
      wanted to stay on Tirumala hills to help people during Kali Yuga (the
      present age). Before staying there, he asked permission from Lord Varaha,
      because Varaha Swami was already the owner of that land. Lord Varaha
      happily gave permission but made one small promise. He said that people
      should visit Varaha Swami first before going to Venkateswara Swami. Lord
      Venkateswara agreed to this promise. That is why many devotees believe
      that their Tirumala trip is not complete unless they first visit Varaha
      Swami Temple. Even today, many pilgrims follow this tradition with great
      faith. The temple is simple and peaceful. The prayers and rituals are done
      daily with devotion. Important festivals like Varaha Jayanti, Vaikuntha
      Ekadashi, and Brahmotsavam are celebrated here. During Brahmotsavam, a
      special holy bath called Chakra Snanam is done in Swami Pushkarini. People
      believe that praying to Varaha Swami helps remove sins and gives good
      health, happiness, and peace. Devotees also believe that Varaha Swami
      protects the Tirumala hills. In short, Sri Varaha Swami Temple is the
      starting point of Tirumala pilgrimage. Visiting this temple first shows
      respect, gratitude, and faith. That is why it holds a very special place
      in the hearts of devotees.
